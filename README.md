# OWCT

As a coding exercise:

### Figuring out that you need to register an account and get an API key: 1 hour

Went back and forth with the agent on this, as, obviously my first try was with Safari, not with code.
And it is only when I decided to actually read the error message associated withe the 401 code that I got it.
=> actually useful error messages are not the norm these days ...

### Setting up an empty project from scracth that nothing but compiles + GitHub setup: 1 hour

This includes reading enough of the OpenWeather docs to get an idea of what is at stake, what I am heading into

### Adding minimal set of my own libraries, one class at a time as I build it up all to an empty screen: 1 hour

This include the basic infrastructure of a "rest" application

### Delving into the API, creating the first network request: 1 hour

This incluedes adding the appropriate entty in the plist to support http (as opposed to https) as required by the service

### Creating a minimal UIView hierachy and plugging it all together + associated constants: 1 hour

This includes a top level view that doesn nothing but supports the WeatherRecord view + Fonts & Color support

### Creating a minimal configuration request such that queries can be issued either by city+country or cityCode or latitude+longitude: 1 hour

### Creating a loader that builds upon the network stack and upon success delegates to a new WeatherRecord factory ton parse from JSON: 1 hour
